            <h3>Research at the Intersection of AI and Society</h3>
            <p>My work pioneers the application of advanced machine learning techniques‚Äîincluding voice activity detection (VAD), automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion recognition (SER), and natural language processing (NLP)‚Äîto analyze police radio communications. This novel approach addresses a critical gap in policing research by examining the coordination and decision-making processes that occur <em>before</em> encounters with the public.</p>
            <p>Theoretically grounded in Spencer's phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory (PVEST), my research bridges computational social science and urban sociology to understand policing as a complex sociotechnical system.</p>

            <h3>Evidence-Based Insights for Police Reform</h3>
            <p>My research provides policymakers with unprecedented access to understanding police behavior through analysis of radio communications‚Äîthe primary coordination tool for officers. This work offers objective, data-driven insights into how officers make decisions, coordinate responses, and interact with communities.</p>
            <p>By analyzing patterns in hundreds of hours of radio transmissions using artificial intelligence, I identify systemic issues and opportunities for intervention that traditional metrics miss.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="insight-card">
              <h4>üõ°Ô∏è Early Intervention Opportunities</h4>

            <h3>Using AI to Understand Policing in Your Community</h3>
            <p>When you hear police sirens or see officers responding to a call, there's an entire conversation happening over radio that guides their actions. My research uses artificial intelligence to listen to and understand these conversations, revealing how police make decisions and coordinate before they interact with community members.</p>
            <p>This work matters because it helps answer questions communities have been asking: How do police decide where to go? How do they talk about neighborhoods? What influences their decisions before they arrive at a scene?</p>
          </div>

          <h3>What This Means for Communities</h3>
          <div class="key-insights">
            <div class="insight-card">
              <h4>üîç Transparency Through Technology</h4>
              <p>By analyzing police radio communications (which are publicly available in many cities), this research reveals patterns in policing that aren't visible in official reports. It's like having a window into how police actually work day-to-day.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-card">
              <h4>üë• Your Data, Your Rights</h4>
              <p>My work on data governance asks: Who should control data about our communities? I'm developing models where communities‚Äînot corporations or government alone‚Äîhave real power over how their data is used.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-card">
              <h4>‚ö° Ahead of the Curve</h4>
              <p>This research anticipated many current conversations about AI ethics, police accountability, and data rights. By studying these issues early, we can shape how these technologies develop rather than just reacting to problems after they arise.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-card">
              <h4>üåç Real-World Impact</h4>
              <p>The goal isn't just academic papers‚Äîit's creating tools and frameworks that help communities hold police accountable and participate meaningfully in decisions about surveillance and safety.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #667eea;">Community Engagement</h4>
            <p>I believe research should serve communities, not just academic journals. If you're interested in understanding policing in your area or want to discuss participatory research approaches, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
