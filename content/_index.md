Found race/ethnicity was by far the strongest factor in residential sorting (homophily), with social class also important while nativity and family status were minor predictors. Demonstrated how computational historical geography reveals segregation patterns invisible in aggregate data.</p>

                  <h3>Stop treating 'AGI' as the north-star goal of AI research</h3>
                  <div class="card-institution">ICML 2025 Position Paper</div>
                  <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Blili-Hamelin B*, <strong>Graziul C*</strong>, Hancox-Li L, Hazan H, El-Mhamdi E-M, Ghosh A, Heller K, Metcalf J, Murai F, Salvaggio E, Smart A, Snider T, Tighanimine M, Ringer T, Mitchell M, Dori-Hacohen S</p>

                  <p class="card-abstract"><strong>Argument:</strong> Focusing on "artificial general intelligence" (AGI) undermines effective AI goal-setting. Identifies six key traps aggravated by AGI discourse:</p>
                  <ol class="traps-list">
                    <li><strong>Illusion of Consensus</strong> – AGI appears to unite but conceals deep disagreements</li>
                    <li><strong>Supercharging Bad Science</strong> – Vague goals enable unfalsifiable claims</li>
                    <li><strong>Presuming Value-Neutrality</strong> – Ignores whose values shape "general" intelligence</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal Lottery</strong> – Assumes AGI automatically achieves all goals</li>
                    <li><strong>Generality Debt</strong> – Promises breadth while delivering narrow applications</li>
                    <li><strong>Normalized Exclusion</strong> – Marginalizes diverse approaches and communities</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> AI research should (1) prioritize specificity in goals, (2) center pluralism about multiple approaches, (3) foster inclusion of diverse disciplines and communities.</p>
