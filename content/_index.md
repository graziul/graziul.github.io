      title: "Building the Foundation (2004-2016)"
      subtitle: "Dual expertise in computational methods and social theory"
      text: |
        <div class="timeline-section">

        ### 2004: Dual BS Degrees with Honors
        **Virginia Tech**

        - **BS in Physics (Honors)** – Quantitative reasoning, experimental methods
        - **BS in Applied Computational Mathematics (Honors)** – Algorithms, numerical analysis

        This rare combination positioned me to bridge computational methods with social science—a convergence that would define my career before "computational social science" became a recognized field.

        ---

        ### 2005-2009: Graduate Training
        **University of Chicago**

        - **MA in Social Science (2005)**
        - **MA in Sociology (2009)**
        - Began integrating computational approaches with sociological theory

        ---

        ### 2008: Published in *Science*
        **Book Review with Terry Nichols Clark**

        "Why Rich States Aren't Republican" – Examining political geography and voting behavior, connecting place, politics, and social patterns.

        [Read in Science →](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1165796)

        **Impact:** Early work connecting spatial analysis with political behavior—foreshadowing later research on how place shapes social life.

        ---

        ### 2012: Healthcare Data Science
        **Medical Care & BMC Health Services Research**

        Two papers applying computational methods to health policy:

        - "Association Between the Commercial Characteristics of Psychotropic Drugs and Their Off-label Use"
        - "Association Between Unemployment Rates and Prescription Drug Utilization"

        Applied data-driven methods to health policy years before "big data" became mainstream in medicine.

        ---

        ### 2016: PhD in Sociology
        **University of Chicago**

        **Dissertation:** "Venues: Locating Social Context"
        **Committee:** Terry N. Clark (Chair), James Evans, Omar McRoberts

        **Abstract:** Introduced "venues" as a new analytic concept to study how physical spaces with ostensible purposes and material culture shape social behavior. Bridged qualitative researchers studying individual spaces and quantitative researchers developing grand spatial models. Argued that venues extend and unify research across spatial scales, advancing sociological understanding of space and place.

        [Read Dissertation →](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/134)

        **Theoretical Contribution:** Developed frameworks for understanding how physical places constrain and enable social action—theoretical groundwork for later empirical work on policing as a spatially-organized system.

        <div class="timeline-section">

        ### 2016-2018: Postdoctoral Research Associate
        **Brown University | Spatial Structures in the Social Sciences**

        **Project:** Geocoding full-count census data (1900-1940) for 69 cities

        - **30M+ records processed** using Python, R, Stata, Matlab
        - Developed novel segregation measures for point-level data
        - Built scalable ETL workflows for historical demographic analysis
        - Analyzed residential patterns for 10+ racial/ethnic groups

        **Methodological Innovation:** Created computational infrastructure to analyze historical segregation at unprecedented scale and granularity. Transformed qualitative historical questions into quantifiable patterns.

        ### 2018: Neighborhood Formation in St. Louis, 1930
        **Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science**
        **Authors:** John Logan, Chris Graziul, Nathan Frey

        **Abstract:** Exploited geocoded data from 100% transcription of the 1930 census to examine neighborhood formation. Found race/ethnicity was by far the strongest factor in residential sorting (homophily), with social class also important while nativity and family status were minor predictors. Demonstrated how computational historical geography reveals segregation patterns invisible in aggregate data.

        [Read Paper →](https://doi.org/10.1177/2399808318801958)

        **Impact:** Documented historical roots of present-day urban inequality. Showed how segregation patterns from the 1930s persist and inform contemporary housing policy.

        ### 2018-2022: Data Scientist
        **University of Chicago | Department of Comparative Human Development**

        **Focus:** Integrating PVEST theory with computational methods

        - Developed PVEST-informed research designs for **NSF STEM-US Center**
        - Assessed arts-augmented STEM curricula effectiveness (7th-8th graders)
        - Evaluated assessment tools for HBCU STEM student success
        - Led IRB protocols, experimental design, secondary data analysis
        - Contributed to multiple successfully funded grants

        **Bridging Theory & Practice:** Pioneered theory-driven data science in education research. Integrated Margaret Beale Spencer's phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory (PVEST) with computational analysis.

        ### 2021-2025: $2.7M NIH R01 Grant
        **Principal Investigator (with Margaret Beale Spencer)**
        **NIH National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities**

        **Grant:** R01MD015064

        **Research Goals:**
        - First NIH-funded analysis of police radio communications
        - Understand how officers' and dispatchers' language impacts encounters with minority male youth
        - Develop assessment tool and training program to reduce negative outcomes
        - Apply PVEST theory to understand reactive coping strategies in stress

        **Significance:** First major federal funding to analyze police language systematically. Positions procedural language as an intervention point for reducing adverse encounters.

        ### 2023: Does Big Data Serve Policy? Not Without Context
        **Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory**
        **Lead Author:** Chris Graziul (with Belikov, Chattopadyay, Evans, et al.)

        **Abstract:** Evaluated social science methodology through DARPA Ground Truth project's simulated worlds. Found that problem-solving without shared ontology—where world characteristics remain uncertain—poses strong limits to quantitative analysis even with common tasks. Demonstrated that contemporary computational social science requires theoretical context to avoid spurious policy recommendations.

        *Srivastava, Chou, Shroff, Livescu, Graziul*

        BPC-CPD Corpus: 62,080 utterances (46.2 hours) manually transcribed from Chicago PD radio across 11 dispatch zones. Fine-tuned models reach human-level performance.

        ### 2025: Stop treating 'AGI' as the north-star goal of AI research
        **ICML 2025 Position Paper** | **Equal Contribution**
        **Authors:** Blili-Hamelin B*, **Graziul C***, Hancox-Li L, Hazan H, El-Mhamdi E-M, Ghosh A, Heller K, Metcalf J, Murai F, Salvaggio E, Smart A, Snider T, Tighanimine M, Ringer T, Mitchell M, Dori-Hacohen S

        **Argument:** Focusing on "artificial general intelligence" (AGI) undermines effective AI goal-setting. Identifies six key traps:

        1. **Illusion of Consensus** – AGI appears to unite but conceals deep disagreements
        2. **Supercharging Bad Science** – Vague goals enable unfalsifiable claims
        3. **Presuming Value-Neutrality** – Ignores whose values shape "general" intelligence
        4. **Goal Lottery** – Assumes AGI automatically achieves all goals
        5. **Generality Debt** – Promises breadth while delivering narrow applications
        6. **Normalized Exclusion** – Marginalizes diverse approaches and communities

        **Recommendation:** AI research should (1) prioritize specificity in goals, (2) center pluralism about multiple approaches, (3) foster inclusion of diverse disciplines and communities.

        ### 2025: The Case for a National Repository of Policing Data
        **20th International Conference on Open Repositories**
        **Authors:** Danton C, Graziul C, Ramos E

        Proposes infrastructure for democratized access to policing data in the United States. Argues for centralized repository that balances transparency with privacy.

        **Presentation:** June 15-18, 2025, Chicago, IL

        ### Ongoing: Participatory Data Governance Research

        Developing decentralized autonomous data stewardship models where communities control their data. Creating alternatives to corporate/government data monopolies that rebalance power between data subjects and data users.
